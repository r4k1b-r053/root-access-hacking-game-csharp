## 📌 Project Overview
The game allows a player to complete multiple hacking challenges to gain system access. It progresses through three main levels:

1. Password Cracking  
2. Firewall Bypass  
3. System Exploit  

Each level demonstrates different **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through real gameplay logic.
